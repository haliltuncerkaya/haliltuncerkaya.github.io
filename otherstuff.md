## Failed Jam Documents

Not all jams are successful. Our team couldn't manage to submit to the [Mystery Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/mystery-game-jam-2024). I have provided my design docs for the first-person escape room game we tried to create:

## Paper Tabletop Game Project

<h3>Meteor Awareness</h3>

![Picture 1](/assets/metAwe.png)

Meteor Awareness is my first ever attempt to create a game. It is a simple paper tabletop game that can be played with 2-6 players, using only a dice and the paper layout below.

 I design small LEGO sets (dubbed as My Own Creation - MOC by LEGO enthusiasts) as a hobby, mainly in the form of LEGO Brickheadz, using BrickLink's software [BrickLink Studio 2.0](https://www.bricklink.com/v3/studio/download.page){:target="_blank"}. 
 
 This is the first design I have created in Studio 2.0. It is the Brickheadz version of Eric Draven, and its resemblance is taken from The Crow movie.

 This is the Brickheadz version of the [Adrax Agatone](https://wh40k.lexicanum.com/wiki/Adrax_Agatone){:target="_blank"} Captain of the Salamanders Chapter's Third Company from the Warhammer 40K universe.
